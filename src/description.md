* **title**: _Clean, beautiful tests_
* **sub-title**: _Writing clean, maintainable, and easy-to-understand tests_

We all know the importance of automated tests. But many times tests are treated like second-rate citizens - they are not held to the same standards of quality like the production code. We tolerate things like code duplication, lack of abstraction, and sometimes it's even hard to understand what the code is really testing. Is there a better way? Is there a way to write better fixtures and assertions, that will cleanup tests, and make it obvious what we're actually testing? Join the session to find out.
