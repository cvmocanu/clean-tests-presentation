# Clean, beautiful tests

**Writing clean, maintainable, and easy-to-understand tests**

We all know the importance of automated tests. But many times tests are treated like second-rate citizens - they are not held to the same standards of quality like the production code. We tolerate things like code duplication, lack of abstraction, and sometimes it's even hard to understand what the code is really testing. Is there a better way? Is there a way to write better fixtures and assertions, that will cleanup tests, and make it obvious what we're actually testing?

This repository contains presentation slides and source code that show how to improve your automated tests.

## DbSchema


I'm currently working on a product called DbSchema, which is the ultimate database design and management tool:
* connect to a wide range of databases
* visually design the database schema
* generate documentation
* use multi-level master-detail trees
* build queries visually
* generate migration scripts
* ... and much more
